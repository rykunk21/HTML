/*
Write a struct that has only two data members, a string named "password" 
and another string named "secret". This struct is called "SecretKeeper". 
The purpose of this type is too only share its secret with users that know 
the password. The struct isn't too secure yet, but we'll learn more ways to 
control information later in the course.

The SecretKeeper type also has a function member named "get_secret" that 
takes a single argument, a string that represents a user providing a 
password. If the user's password matches the struct's password, return the 
secret, otherwise, return a empty string.

Be sure to separate your code into a header file (secret.h) and an 
implementation file (secret.cpp).

string SecretKeeper::get_secret(string usr_password){
    if (usr_password == password){
        return secret;
    } else {
        return "";
    }
}
