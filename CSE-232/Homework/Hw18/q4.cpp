/*
For this code problem, start with your working solution from the previous 
code problem. But here you need to add some new funtionality.

First off, each counter object should have a public data member called 
"log_" it is a vector of strings. It starts empty, but each method call 
on the object should add a string to the log_. See the test cases for exact 
formating.

Be sure the two existing functions (constructor and value) log themselves.

Then implement the << operator so that a Constructor can write itself to a 
stream. It shoudl write "Counter(9)@8" if the counter was initialized with 
the value 9 and the next value to be returned by the "value" member function 
is an 8.

Next implement the + operator when returns a new counter that has an initial 
value and current values that is the sum of the two counters' data members.
