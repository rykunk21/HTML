In this project, you will be creating a bank account calculator that can process 
withdraws and deposits, calculate interest, and apply overdraft fees. The 
program must be in a file called "bank_account.hpp" and must have a number of functions.

 

The most important function is named "process_commands". It takes as arguments 
a multiline string (where each line of the string denotes a date and an instruction) 
and a double denoting the Annual Percent Rate (apr, i.e. the interest rate for 
the account). This function returns a multiline string denoting the results of 
performing the instructions requested.

Example Test Case (00: Final Goal):


string input = 
"2016-09-02 Deposit $500\n"
"2016-09-02 Withdraw $23.54\n"
"2016-09-04 Withdraw $58\n"
"2016-11-02 Deposit $200\n"
"2017-03-02 Withdraw $1000\n"
"2019-11-02 Deposit $500\n";

string result = process_commands(input, 7);

string expected = 
"On 2016-09-02: Instructed to perform \"Deposit $500\"\n"
"Balance: 500.00\n"
"On 2016-09-02: Instructed to perform \"Withdraw $23.54\"\n"
"Balance: 476.46\n"
"On 2016-09-04: Instructed to perform \"Withdraw $58\"\n"
"Balance: 418.46\n"
"On 2016-11-02: Instructed to perform \"Deposit $200\"\n"
"Since 2016-09-04, interest has accrued 2 times.\n"
"$4.89 interest has been earned.\n"
"Balance: 623.35\n"
"On 2017-03-02: Instructed to perform \"Withdraw $1000\"\n"
"Since 2016-11-02, interest has accrued 4 times.\n"
"$14.65 interest has been earned.\n"
"Overdraft!\n"
"Balance: -397.00\n"
"On 2019-11-02: Instructed to perform \"Deposit $500\"\n"
"Since 2017-03-02, interest has accrued 32 times.\n"
"$0.00 interest has been earned.\n"
"Balance: 103.00\n";

ASSERT_EQ(result, expected);

Note: C++ doesn't have nice multiline strings, so I'm utilizing the fact that 
C++ will automatically concatentate adjacent string literals to make a single large string. 

This project does no IO (no cout, no cin), it is all string processing.

The "process_commands" function is far to complicated to write as a single 
function, you will need to make helper functions to assist this function do its work.

The description of each of the helper functions is in the description of each 
test case with that function's name.

Also, 25 points for this project are dedicated to "manual grading" by the 
instructors. We will be grading your code's quality. You should not have 
redundant code (don't repeat yourself); you should be using "const" when 
appropriate; you should be generating good, clear, and informative names for 
your variables; you should be using references and pointers when needed to 
avoid unnecessary copies. Things like that.
